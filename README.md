# Puck

Software can sometimes feel a bit like:

> I'll follow you. I'll lead you about a round,
> Through a bog, through bush, through brake, through brier.
> Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
> A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire,
> And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
> Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn. (III.i.)  

- Puck in Act III of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream"

Let's try to tame the complexity!
